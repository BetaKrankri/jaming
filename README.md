# [Jamming](https://dynamic-cheesecake-dd375c.netlify.app) with Quike _App_

## This is my first app with React Class Components.
This app let you search for tracks in Spotify's tracks DB.
You can add tracks to a playlist, name it and save it into your Spotify account (need to logIn).

### Objectives
* Create an React app
* Fetch data from Spotify API and work with the reponse.
* Use React Class components.
